# ðŸ”’ Enterprise Lab Network Security Configuration

This README documents the security features implemented in an enterprise lab network to simulate realistic, enterprise-grade security controls on Layer 2 and Layer 3 devices.  
**Management security and device hardening are excluded from this documentation.**  
The goal is to enforce a Zero Trust model, protect against common Layer 2/3 attacks, and ensure network stability and scalability.

## 1. VLAN Segmentation & Inter-VLAN ACLs (Zero Trust)

**Purpose:** Enforce Zero Trust by explicitly controlling inter-VLAN communication using Extended Access Control Lists (ACLs).  
ACLs are applied **inbound** on each Switched Virtual Interface (SVI) of distribution (multilayer) switches.

```bash
ip access-list extended VLAN10_IN
 deny ip 10.1.1.0 0.0.0.255 20.1.1.0 0.0.0.255
 deny ip 10.1.1.0 0.0.0.255 30.1.1.0 0.0.0.255
 deny ip 10.1.1.0 0.0.0.255 40.1.1.0 0.0.0.255
 permit ip any any

interface vlan10
 ip access-group VLAN10_IN in
```

âœ… Prevents direct communication between VLANs.
âœ… Only explicitly permitted traffic (e.g., Internet-bound) is allowed.

2. DHCP Snooping
Purpose: Prevent rogue DHCP servers from assigning malicious IP addresses.
Enabled on all switches for VLANs 10, 20, 30, and 40.
Only uplink/trunk interfaces to trusted devices (MS1, MS2, Core) are trusted.

```bash
Copia codice
ip dhcp snooping
ip dhcp snooping vlan 10,20,30,40

interface fa0/5
 ip dhcp snooping trust
```
âœ… Ensures DHCP replies are only accepted from trusted ports.
âœ… Mitigates unauthorized DHCP server attacks.

3. Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI)
Purpose: Mitigate ARP spoofing and Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.
Enabled for VLANs 10, 20, 30, and 40.
Trusted ports explicitly defined; access ports remain untrusted.

bash
Copia codice
ip arp inspection vlan 10,20,30,40

interface fa0/1
 ip arp inspection limit rate 30

interface fa0/5
 ip arp inspection trust
âœ… Validates ARP packets against DHCP Snooping bindings.
âœ… Protects against ARP poisoning.

4. Port Security
Purpose: Restrict the number of devices per access port.
Applied on all access ports with a maximum of 2 MAC addresses.

```bash
Copia codice
interface range fa0/1 - 24
 switchport mode access
 switchport port-security
 switchport port-security maximum 2
 switchport port-security violation restrict
 switchport port-security mac-address sticky
```
âœ… Limits devices per port.
âœ… Restricts unknown MAC addresses.
âœ… Dynamically learns and saves MAC addresses.

5. BPDU Guard & STP PortFast
Purpose: Protect STP topology and speed up convergence for host ports.

```bash
Copia codice
interface range fa0/1 - 24
 spanning-tree bpduguard enable
 spanning-tree portfast
```
âœ… Prevents rogue switches in STP.
âœ… Reduces convergence time.

6. Storm Control
Purpose: Mitigate broadcast and multicast storms.
Applied on all access ports, limiting traffic to 5% of bandwidth.

```bash
Copia codice
interface range fa0/1 - 24
 storm-control broadcast level 5.00
 storm-control multicast level 5.00
```
âœ… Drops excessive broadcast/multicast traffic.
âœ… Protects network stability.

7. Trusted Uplink Ports
Purpose: Ensure correct functionality of control-plane protocols.
Trunk/uplink ports to distribution switches and routers are marked as trusted.

```bash
Copia codice
interface fa0/24
 switchport mode trunk
 ip dhcp snooping trust
 ip arp inspection trust
```
âœ… Prevents false positives on uplinks.
âœ… Ensures smooth inter-switch communication.
