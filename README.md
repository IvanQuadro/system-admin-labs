# System Administration Lab Projects

Hi! I'm an entry-level IT professional with a background in languages and a strong focus on system administration, networking, and cybersecurity.  

This repository contains six practical projects developed during my preparation for the CCNA 200-301 certification, designed to build job-ready skills and demonstrate my hands-on experience with real-world IT scenarios.

Each project covers essential system administration topics such as network configuration, Linux permissions, automation with Bash scripting, DHCP setup, monitoring tools, and VLAN segmentation. All projects are organized in separate directories and include detailed documentation.

## 📁 Included Projects

1. [Project_1 Basic Network Setup with VLANs and Static Routing](Project_1_Basic_Network_Setup)  
   A two-site network topology featuring Cisco routers, switches, and end devices. Includes VLAN configuration, router subinterfaces, static routing, and inter-VLAN communication between multiple subnets across areas.

2. [Project 2 – VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP) and Router-on-a-Stick (ROAS) Setup](./Project_2_Layer_2_Switching_and_VLANs)  
   A Layer 2 network configuration featuring a centralized VTP server, two VTP clients, and a router using subinterfaces for inter-VLAN routing. Includes VLAN propagation, trunk links, and PC assignments across multiple VLANs.

3. [Project_3 IP Routing with OSPF and Static Routes](./Project_3_IP_Routing_with_OSPF)  
   Network simulation using static routes and OSPF to demonstrate manual and dynamic IP routing across multiple routers and segments.

4. [Project_4 Syslog and NTP Configuration](./Project_4_Syslog_NTP)  
   Centralized event logging and network time synchronization using Syslog and NTP protocols in a small subnet topology.

5. [Project 5 – DHCP, VLANs and Router-on-a-Stick](./Project_5_dhcp)
   
   Network segmentation using VLANs with a centralized DHCP server and inter-VLAN routing via Router-on-a-Stick. Demonstrates dynamic IP assignment, subinterface configuration, and trunking for efficient Layer 3 communication.

5.1. [Project 5.1 – DHCP, VLANs and Router-on-a-Stick](./Project_5.1_dhcp)

   Segmented network utilizing VLANs 10 and 20, with a centralized DHCP server. Router performs inter-VLAN routing using subinterfaces (Router-on-a-Stick). Each       VLAN is assigned its own IP range, gateway, and DHCP pool. The network includes IP helper addresses to relay DHCP requests across VLANs.
   

6. [Project_6_vlans-etherchannel-hsrp-ospf](Project_6_vlans-etherchannel-hsrp-ospf)  
   Advanced configuration of VLANs, EtherChannel, HSRP, and OSPF for a resilient and segmented network. Includes VLAN management, link aggregation, redundancy, and dynamic routing.

7. [Project 7 – Hierarchical Network Design with Redundancy](Project_7_dhcp_vtp_portsecurity)
   
   Three-tier Cisco network architecture implementing Core, Distribution, and Access layers. Demonstrates scalable and redundant design using multilayer switches, multiple uplinks, and structured segmentation. Ideal for enterprise-level networks requiring high availability, fault tolerance, and efficient traffic management.
