# System Administration Lab Projects

Welcome to my repository of hands-on projects focused on system administration. This collection includes six practical exercises developed during my training for the CCNA certification and as preparation for entering the IT job market.

Each project is designed to simulate real-world scenarios a system administrator might encounter, with the goal of reinforcing technical skills in networking, scripting, automation, and operating system management.

## 📁 Included Projects

1. [Basic LAN Configuration](./project1-basic-lan-setup)  
   Simulation of a local area network setup using Cisco switches and routers, static IP addressing, and basic routing.

2. [User and Permission Management on Linux](./project2-linux-users-permissions)  
   Creating users and groups, managing file permissions, and applying basic security policies on a Linux system.

3. [Automated Backup Scripts](./project3-backup-scripts)  
   Bash scripts for scheduled backups of files and directories, including automatic logging and error handling.

4. [DHCP Server Installation and Configuration](./project4-dhcp-server-setup)  
   Setting up a DHCP server in a virtual network, with dynamic IP assignment and subnet configuration.

5. [Monitoring with Open-Source Tools](./project5-network-monitoring)  
   Using tools like Nagios and Netdata to monitor system performance, network status, and running services.

6. [Enterprise Network Simulation with VLANs](./project6-enterprise-multivlan)  
   Design and implementation of a corporate network using multiple VLANs, trunking, and inter-VLAN routing on Cisco devices.

Each project is located in its own subdirectory and includes a dedicated `README.md` with detailed technical explanations, configurations, command references, and step-by-step instructions.
