# System Administration Lab Projects

Hi! I'm an entry-level IT professional with a background in languages and a strong focus on system administration, networking, and cybersecurity.  

This repository contains six practical projects developed during my preparation for the CCNA 200-301 certification, designed to build job-ready skills and demonstrate my hands-on experience with real-world IT scenarios.

Each project covers essential system administration topics such as network configuration, Linux permissions, automation with Bash scripting, DHCP setup, monitoring tools, and VLAN segmentation. All projects are organized in separate directories and include detailed documentation.

## 📁 Included Projects

0. [Project_0 Basic Network Setup with VLANs and Static Routing](Project_0_Basic_Network_Setup)  
   A two-site network topology featuring Cisco routers, switches, and end devices. Includes VLAN configuration, router subinterfaces, static routing, and inter-VLAN communication between multiple subnets across areas.

1. [Project 1 – VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP) and Router-on-a-Stick (ROAS) Setup](./Project_1_Layer_2_Switching_and_VLANs)  
   A Layer 2 network configuration featuring a centralized VTP server, two VTP clients, and a router using subinterfaces for inter-VLAN routing. Includes VLAN propagation, trunk links, and PC assignments across multiple VLANs.

2. [Project_2 IP Routing with OSPF and Static Routes](./Project_2_IP_Routing_with_OSPF)  
   Network simulation using static routes and OSPF to demonstrate manual and dynamic IP routing across multiple routers and segments.

3. [Project_3 Syslog and NTP Configuration](./Project_3_Syslog_NTP)  
   Centralized event logging and network time synchronization using Syslog and NTP protocols in a small subnet topology.

4. [Monitoring with Open-Source Tools](./project5-network-monitoring)  
   Using tools like Nagios and Netdata to monitor system performance, network status, and running services.

5. [Enterprise Network Simulation with VLANs](./project6-enterprise-multivlan)  
   Design and implementation of a corporate network using multiple VLANs, trunking, and inter-VLAN routing on Cisco devices.

Each project is located in its own subdirectory and includes a dedicated `README.md` with detailed technical explanations, configurations, command references, and step-by-step instructions.
