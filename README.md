Basic Network Topology with Packet Tracer
Description 
This is a simple network topology designed using Cisco Packet Tracer, intended for educational or basic testing purposes. The network includes:

2 routers (Router0, Router1)

2 switches (Switch0, Switch1)

4 PCs (PC0, PC1, PC2, PC3)

The network is divided into two LAN segments connected via two routers. Each LAN consists of a switch and two connected PCs.

Objectives
Understand the basic concept of interconnecting network devices.

Simulate a simple network with communication between devices in different LANs.

Test routing between two subnets via routers.

Topology Details
PC0 and PC1 are connected to Switch0, which is connected to Router0.

PC2 and PC3 are connected to Switch1, which is connected to Router1.

Router0 and Router1 are connected via a point-to-point link.

Possible Extensions
Assign static IP addresses to each device.

Configure static or dynamic routing (e.g., RIP, OSPF) on the routers.

Add a DHCP or DNS server for more advanced simulations.

Requirements
Cisco Packet Tracer (version 7.2 or higher recommended)

How to Use
Clone this repository.

Open the .pkt file in Cisco Packet Tracer.

Configure IP addresses and routing as needed.

Test connectivity using the ping tool or other simulation features.
