# System Administration Lab Projects

Hi! I'm an entry-level IT professional with a background in languages and a strong focus on system administration, networking, and cybersecurity.  

This repository contains six practical projects developed during my preparation for the CCNA 200-301 certification, designed to build job-ready skills and demonstrate my hands-on experience with real-world IT scenarios.

Each project covers essential system administration topics such as network configuration, Linux permissions, automation with Bash scripting, DHCP setup, monitoring tools, and VLAN segmentation. All projects are organized in separate directories and include detailed documentation.

## 📁 Included Projects

1. [Basic Network Setup with VLANs and Static Routing](Project_0_Basic_Network_Setup)  
   A two-site network topology featuring Cisco routers, switches, and end devices. Includes VLAN configuration, router subinterfaces, static routing, and inter-VLAN communication between multiple subnets across areas.

2. [User and Permission Management on Linux](./project2-linux-users-permissions)  
   Creating users and groups, managing file permissions, and applying basic security policies on a Linux system.

3. [Automated Backup Scripts](./project3-backup-scripts)  
   Bash scripts for scheduled backups of files and directories, including automatic logging and error handling.

4. [DHCP Server Installation and Configuration](./project4-dhcp-server-setup)  
   Setting up a DHCP server in a virtual network, with dynamic IP assignment and subnet configuration.

5. [Monitoring with Open-Source Tools](./project5-network-monitoring)  
   Using tools like Nagios and Netdata to monitor system performance, network status, and running services.

6. [Enterprise Network Simulation with VLANs](./project6-enterprise-multivlan)  
   Design and implementation of a corporate network using multiple VLANs, trunking, and inter-VLAN routing on Cisco devices.

Each project is located in its own subdirectory and includes a dedicated `README.md` with detailed technical explanations, configurations, command references, and step-by-step instructions.
